# GitSoc: A Social Media Platform Powered by Git

Welcome to the official repo of GitSoc, the social media platform that uses Git under the hood! Every interaction, from posts to comments, is treated as a commit. This approach brings transparency, version control, and collaboration into the social media space.

## Features

- __Freedom of Speech & Transparency:__ A platform committed to freedom of expression, ensuring transparency and minimal censorship.*
- __Git-Driven Interactions:__ Every post, comment, and edit is a Git commit.
- __Immutable History:__ All changes are tracked, ensuring transparency.
- __Open Source:__ Contribute to and modify the platform.

*Freedom of expression does not mean freedom from consequences. While you won't be censored or banned for your shitty opinions (or lack thereof), we don't allow illegal material on our platform in any format, and we will make it our life's mission to prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law for (including, but not limited to) instigating unnecessary violence/hatecrimes/etc, spreading revenge porn, and anything that brings harm to minors. Fuck around and find out.
